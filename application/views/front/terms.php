Depending on where you live, the information that you provide and that this Site collects may be stored on servers that are outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction, and the privacy laws that apply may not be as protective as those in your home jurisdiction. If you are located outside the Bangladesh and choose to provide information to us, Bangladesh transfers personal information to other countries and processes it there.

  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Liability</p>
  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; YOUR ATTENTION IS DRAWN PARTICULARLY TO THIS CLAUSE AND THE LIMITS OF OUR LIABILITY WITHIN IT. As a responsible business, Amar Bahok and the respective Riders/Freelancers shall hopefully perform the Service(s) in a professional manner with the appropriate level of skill and care. Amar Bahok Parcels will not take full liability of any item that is damaged or lost. Damage to a Consignment may still occur as a consequence of handling of it and in such circumstances, Amar Bahok and the Riders/Freelancer liability shall be limited as set out in these Terms and Conditions. The reasoning behind this limitation of our liability is as follows: The value of a Consignment and the amount of potential loss to you that could arise if a Consignment is damaged or lost is not something which can be easily ascertained but is something which is better known to you. In many cases it cannot be known to Amar Bahok or the Rider/Freelancer at all and can only be known to you; The potential amount of loss that might be caused or alleged to be caused to you is likely to be disproportionate to the sum that could reasonably be expected to charge you for providing the Service(s) under this Agreement; It is not possible to obtain cover which would give unlimited compensation for full potential liability to all customers and, even if it were, such cover would be much cheaper if taken out by you and on that basis, it is more reasonable for you to take out such cover from an independent third party. It is imperative to keep the costs of providing the Service(s) to you as low as possible; In these Terms and Conditions, damage to you means any loss of, or damage to, a Consignment.</p>
  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Amar Bahok. shall not be liable to you: a) Under any circumstances where there are any material discrepancies between the declared dimensions and weights and the actual dimensions and weights; c) In any circumstances in respect of the items on the Prohibited items; Special Provisions items and for damage to the No Compensation Items lists, unless otherwise stated by us. To the best of our abilities, we can connect you through to the rightful authority to investigate damage or loss of your item. However, we will not be held liable to damage of your item or loss because of the aforementioned reasons in these Terms and Conditions.</p>
  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; PAYMENT</p>
  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You may choose to pay for the services by cash and where available, by using Amar Bahok Credits as detailed below. Once you have used the Service, you are required to make payment in full to the rider/freelancer and such payment is non-refundable. If you have any complaints in relation to the transportation service provided, then that dispute must be taken up with the third-party rider/freelancer provider directly. That you have to pay the riders upfront. Failure to do so will result in the rider cancelling your request. That you may not ask riders to receive cash payment from the receiver. Selecting a particular payment method means you are agreeing to the terms of service of the Company&rsquo;s processing partners and your financial institution. You will bear all fees that may be charged by such processing partners and/or your financial institution (if any) for the payment method you have selected.</p>
  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; TAXES</p>
  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You agree that this Agreement shall be subject to all prevailing statutory taxes, duties, fees, charges and/or costs, however denominated, as may be in force in your own country and in connection with any future taxes that may be introduced at any point of time. You further agree to use your best efforts to do everything necessary and required by the relevant laws to enable, assist and/or defend the Company to claim or verify any input tax credit, set off, rebate or refund in respect of any taxes paid or payable in connection with the Service supplied under this Agreement.</p>
